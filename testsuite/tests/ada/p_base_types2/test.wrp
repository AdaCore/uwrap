# this test checks that it's possible to iterate over all the element of an
# array in a function, and to use such function in a filter recursively
# calling that function at least twice. We want to verify in particular that
# iteration control from the filter works propertly, e.g. that when a matching
# value is found, the iteration in the function stops.
