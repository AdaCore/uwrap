UWrap
=====

UWrap is a tool aimed at processing trees structure, identifying patterns and
generating another tree structure as a result. The main use case currently
implemented and documented is to process an Ada source tree generated by
libadalang in order to either genreate various kind of messages and analysis,
or to wrap it around another Ada source file. This can be used in particular
to wrap a thin binidng generated by -fdump-ada-specs to a thicker binding.

Documentation
=============

Full documentation is currently work in progress. However, a 
[Tutorial](https://github.com/AdaCore/uwrap/tree/master/documentation/tutorial) is 
available to provide basic concepts from a user point of view.

Build
=====

To build UWrap, you will need a recent version of the GNAT Ada compiler, as
well as [Langkit](https://github.com/AdaCore/langkit) and [Libadalang](https://github.com/AdaCore/libadalang).

To make the project, you will first need to build its two dependencies 
lang_template and lang_test, and properly set the path:

~~~sh
cd lang_test
make
cd ../lang_template
make
cd ..
. env.sh
gprbuild
~~~
